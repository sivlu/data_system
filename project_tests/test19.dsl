-- Needs test8.dsl and test9.dsl to have been executed first.
-- This query uses tbl2
--
-- tbl2 has a secondary b-tree tree index on col1 and col2, and a clustered index on col7 with the form of a sorted column
--
-- this is a test for correctness on a complex query
--
-- Query in SQL:
-- SELECT max(col1+col5) FROM tbl2 WHERE col1 >= 21000000 and col1 < 510000000 and col7 >= 61000000 and col7 < 1010000000 and col6 >= 410000000 and col6 < 8100000000
--
-- The exact DSL of this query is left for you to design. You can decide (and experiment) with the order of the select operators, which indexes to use and/or test alternative operators.
