/**
 * db_operator
 * The db_operator defines a database operation.  Generally, an operation will
 * be applied on column(s) of a table (SELECT, PROJECT, AGGREGATE) while other
 * operations may involve multiple tables (JOINS). The OperatorType defines
 * the kind of operation.
 *
 * In UNARY operators that only require a single table, only the variables
 * related to table1/column1 will be used.
 * In BINARY operators, the variables related to table2/column2 will be used.
 *
 * If you are operating on more than two tables, you should rely on separating
 * it into multiple operations (e.g., if you have to project on more than 2
 * tables, you should select in one operation, and then create separate
 * operators for each projection).
 *
 * Example query:
 * SELECT a FROM A WHERE A.a < 100;
 * db_operator op1;
 * op1.table1 = A;
 * op1.column1 = b;
 *
 * filter f;
 * f.value = 100;
 * f.type = LESS_THAN;
 * f.mode = NONE;
 *
 * op1.comparator = f;
